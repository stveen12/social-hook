# LinkedIn Profile PDF Downloader
This script collects and downloads LinkedIn profiles (as PDFs) from the **“People you may know”** suggestion list.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- When first run, it opens LinkedIn in Chrome.
- You must **log in manually** in the opened browser window.
- After logging in, press **Enter in the terminal** to save your session cookies.
- Next runs will **reuse the saved cookies** from `linkedin_cookies.pkl`.
- If the cookies expire, **delete `linkedin_cookies.pkl`** — the script will ask you to log in again.
